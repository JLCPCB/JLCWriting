# JLCPCB

**JiaLiChuang (HongKong) Co., Limited (JLCPCB)** is a Chinese technology company headquartered in HongKong, that manufactures PCB and related products.

## Overview

JLCPCB services include PCB fabrication, SMT assembly, PCB assembly, and 3D printing.
The PCB fabrication capability is up to 6 layers and supports FR4 and Aluminium PCBs.
The company has offices in Hongkong, Shenzhen, Krefeld (Germany), a prototyping factory in Shenzhen, and has 5 more factories for batch production in Zhuhai, Huizhou, Huaian, Jiangsu, and Guangdong province.

## History

JLCPCB was founded by Yuan Jiangtao in 2006 ([1][1]).

JLCPCB started receiving PCB orders from the self-ordering website in 2011.

In 2014, EasyEDA ([2][2]), an online PCB design platform, was launched and JLCPCB provided a direct way to turn the designs from EasyEDA into a prototype. As the EasyEDA community grows, more people were using JLCPCB as their first PCBA choice.

JLCPCB started SMT assembly service in 2016.

In Nov 2021, JLCPCB started an online 3D-printing service.
Like their PCB and PCBA services, 3D printing was also priced very low compared to other dedicated 3D printing services ([3][3]).

JLCPCB net value is estimated as 16 billion RMB and ranked at 89 in China Unicorn Index 2021 ([4][4]), ranked at 305 in Global Unicorn Index 2021 ([5][5]).

## Reputation

JLCPCB had got mixed reviews.
Most people agree that JLCPCB pricing is very cheap and no other company can compete with ([6][6], [7][7]).

Some reports say the PCB quality is not good. tough other reviewers are quite satisfied with their quality ([8][8], [9][9]).

JLCPCB made their parts warehouse status public, which let people check the availability of their parts while designing and ordering.
This is an important factor that JLCPCB can deliver PCBA results faster than many other PCBA companies.
For those that are out of stock or not available in their warehouse, JLCPCB provides a pre-order service ([10][10]).
